                  <h3>Our Commitment</h3>
                  <p>
                    MTS believes that publishing corporate policies is critical
                    to its business objectives, reputation, and maintaining
                    client satisfaction. As part of our commitment, we have
                    adopted the following policy statements: Confidentiality,
                    Impartiality, Cancellation, Payment, Rush Jobs, and Privacy.
                  </p>

                  <h3>1. Confidentiality</h3>
                  <p>
                    Both Interpreters and Translators for MTS have on file
                    several agreements. Foremost, is a signed Non-Disclosure
                    Agreement (NDA). This contract states that all information
                    attained in the course of their professional duties will
                    remain strictly confidential. With this in mind, Linguists
                    will not communicate, publish, or in any way divulge to any
                    organization, or person, other than MTS staff who have a
                    need to know and the organization or person(s) engaging the
                    services of the MTS Interpreter or Translator.
                  </p>

                  <h3>2. Impartiality</h3>
                  <p>
                    All MTS Interpreters and Translators are required to follow
                    the Code of Ethics, which defines the procedures, standards,
                    and moral guidelines governing their professional conduct.
                    Additionally, certain Interpreters and Translators,
                    depending on governmental or legal requirements, must
                    undergo a thorough background check.
                  </p>

                  <h4>Professional Responsibilities</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Their responsibilities are strictly limited to
                      interpreting and translating.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      While performing their duties, they must not offer advice,
                      express personal opinions, or engage in activities outside
                      the scope of their role.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      They are expected to provide complete and accurate
                      interpretations or translations to the best of their
                      ability, without altering, omitting, or adding
                      information, and without offering unsolicited
                      explanations.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      MTS Interpreters and Translators maintain impartiality and
                      objectivity, avoiding any behavior that might suggest
                      bias.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Personal opinions must never influence their work, and
                      they only make recommendations when necessary to
                      facilitate communication.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Finally, they must disclose any actual or perceived
                      conflicts of interest and must not exploit, financially or
                      otherwise, any information acquired through their work.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <h3>3. Cancellation</h3>
                  <p>
                    We understand that plans don't always go as expected, and
                    cancellations may sometimes be necessary. For all regional
                    interpreting services, a 24-hour (one business day, unless
                    otherwise specified) notice prior to the assignment is
                    required to avoid the minimum charge. For assignments
                    outside of Columbus, OH, cancellation terms may differ and
                    will be specified in your Terms & Conditions Agreement.
                    Translation projects and regional simultaneous conference
                    interpreting assignments may also be cancelled; however, a
                    proportional fee will apply for work already completed, as
                    outlined in the Terms & Conditions Agreement.
                  </p>

                  <h3>4. Payment</h3>
                  <p>
                    MTS is a professional language services firm. Our work is
                    provided on a fee-for-service basis, determined by the
                    volume of words, hours, or days required for translation or
                    related services. We provide fee estimates based on the
                    anticipated scope of work and adjust them as needed
                    according to the actual time or volume worked.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    If the actual workload is less than estimated, you will be
                    charged proportionately less. Conversely, if the project
                    requires additional work beyond the original estimate, we
                    will seek your approval before proceeding. This approach
                    ensures financial transparency and discipline, tailored to
                    your business needs.
                  </p>

                    matters. Consequently, we offer Rush Services, Last Minute

                    services are available at additional percentages above
                    standard rates, depending on the specific circumstances and
                    what service you need. We will do our best to accommodate
                    your unique situation.
                  </p>
