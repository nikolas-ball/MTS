                  <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
                  <p>
                    Midwest Translation Services, LLC ("MTS," "we" and "us"),
                    has created this website (the "Website" or the "Site") to
                    provide you with information about our translation and
                    interpretation services (the "Services") and to help you
                    determine which Services are most relevant to your needs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    MTS is committed to maintaining your privacy. This privacy
                    policy and agreement ("Privacy Policy") covers how we
                    collect, use, and treat personal information that you may
                    provide through our Website and through our Services
                    offline. Our Privacy Policy applies to any visitor to the
                    Website (collectively, "you" and "Site Visitor").
                  </p>

                  <h3>2. Your Consent</h3>
                  <p>
                    Please read this Privacy Policy carefully; once you consent
                    to this Policy's terms, it creates legal obligations on you
                    and on MTS. By accessing and using our Website, you are
                    acknowledging that you have read and understood this Privacy
                    Policy and agree to be legally bound by it. If you do not
                    agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please refrain
                    from using our Site and our Services.
                  </p>

                  <h3>3. Types of Information You May Provide</h3>
                  <p>
                    While using our Site or participating in our Services, the
                    information you provide—or that we collect from
                    you—generally falls into two categories: (i) personally
                    identifiable information and (ii) aggregate or anonymous
                    information.
                  </p>

                  <h4>Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</h4>
                  <p>
                    This refers to any information that could reasonably be used
                    to identify you. Examples include your name, address, email
                    address, birth date, financial details, photograph, phone
                    number, or any combination of these data points.
                  </p>

                  <h4>Anonymous Information</h4>
                  <p>
                    This refers to information that does not reveal your
                    identity. It may include statistical or aggregated data,
                    such as which pages on our Site are visited most frequently.
                  </p>

                  <h3>
                    4. Personally Identifiable Information and How We Use It
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    Providing Personally Identifiable Information is entirely
                    your choice. Our Website is designed so that you can browse
                    and access certain Services without sharing any PII. We will
                    only share the PII you voluntarily provide through the Site
                    or Services with third parties as explicitly described in
                    this section. We do not share your information in any other
                    manner.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Information may be collected from Site Visitors at various
                    points on our Website and is used as follows:
                  </p>

                  <h4>4.1 Quote Information</h4>
                  <p>
                    You may request a quote from us for our Services. To provide
                    an accurate quote, we ask that you submit details about the
                    services you anticipate needing, including—but not limited
                    to—the type of interpretation or translation services, the
                    relevant languages, a description of your requirements, and
                    your contact information (collectively, "Quote
                    Information"). We use your Quote Information solely to
                    prepare an accurate quote for the services you request. A
                    record of your Quote Information will be maintained offline.
                  </p>

                  <h4>4.2 Email Addresses</h4>
                  <p>
                    We may offer you the option to subscribe to periodic email
                    updates about our Services. You may also choose to share
                    comments or feedback regarding our Site. When you
                    communicate with us for these purposes, you may provide your
                    email address and other personally identifiable information.
                    Any information you provide will be used solely for the
                    purpose for which it was submitted. If you subscribe to our
                    email updates, you can opt out at any time.
                  </p>

                  <h4>4.3 Questionnaires and Surveys</h4>
                  <p>
                    Our Website may offer opportunities to participate in
                    surveys and/or questionnaires, which we may make available
                    on the Site periodically. Participation is entirely
                    voluntary. In some cases, we may request that you provide
                    Personally Identifiable Information along with your
                    responses. Any information you submit will be used solely
                    for the purpose for which it was provided.
                  </p>

                  <h4>4.4 Informational Notices and Bulletins</h4>
                  <p>
                    From time to time, we may send news, bulletins, marketing
                    materials, or other information to Site Visitors who have
                    previously provided their email address to MTS. Personally
                    Identifiable Information may be used to deliver these
                    communications. If you receive such messages, you can opt
                    out of them at any time.
                  </p>

                  <h3>5. Anonymous, Aggregate Information</h3>
                  <p>
                    As noted above, you can access and use our Site without
                    submitting any personal information. In such cases, the only
                    information we collect is Anonymous Information, which
                    cannot identify you personally. We use this Anonymous
                    Information to evaluate our Site's performance, enhance our
                    Services, and for other similar purposes. Occasionally, we
                    may conduct or commission statistical and summary analyses
                    of user behavior, visitor characteristics, or other general
                    trends. We may share this Anonymous Information with third
                    parties, including advertisers. However, any information
                    shared in this manner will never reveal your identity or any
                    personal details.
                  </p>

                  <h4>5.1 IP Addresses and Logs</h4>
                  <p>
                    MTS may automatically collect and store certain information
                    from your browser in our server logs. This can include your
                    IP address (the unique address of your computer on the
                    Internet), your computer's name, your browser type and
                    version, referring URLs, and other standard log data. We may
                    also track page views (hit counts) and other general usage
                    statistics, which are aggregated with data from other users
                    to help us understand how the Website is used, as well as
                    for security and monitoring purposes. None of this
                    information contains personally identifiable details.
                  </p>

                  <h4>5.2 Cookies</h4>
                  <p>
                    A cookie is a small piece of data, often containing an
                    anonymous unique identifier, that is sent from a website to
                    your browser and stored on your computer's hard drive.
                    Cookies help provide a more personalized browsing experience
                    and make it easier for you to navigate the website on future
                    visits. Our Website may use cookies to recognize you when
                    you return. You can adjust your browser settings to refuse
                    cookies; however, some personalized features of our Website
                    may require cookies to be enabled.
                  </p>

                  <h4>5.3 Tags</h4>
                  <p>
                    We may use "pixel tags" — small graphic images, also called
                    "web beacons" or "single-pixel GIFs" — to track which parts
                    of our website are visited and to evaluate the effectiveness
                    of searches performed on our Site. Pixel tags also help us
                    format email messages properly and indicate whether emails
                    have been opened, allowing us to ensure our messages are
                    relevant to the recipients.
                  </p>

                  <h3>6. Security</h3>
                  <p>
                    We have implemented security measures designed to prevent
                    unauthorized access to, or disclosure of, the Personally
                    Identifiable Information (PII) you provide to us. We take
                    all reasonable steps to protect and safeguard this
                    information. All MTS employees are required to acknowledge
                    and adhere to our policies regarding the confidentiality of
                    PII.
